			<p>Laura Boone became an educator in 2004 and after 4 years in the classroom moved into Educational Technology where she has spent her time supporting teachers, schools, and districts in defining best practices. She has taught preK through 12th grade, worked as an IT tech, a technology coach, and most recently served as the Coordinator for Online and Alternative Learning for a school district in Arizona.  </p>
	
			<p>Recently returning to Cleveland, Laura looks forward to supporting businesses and schools in preparing students for college, career, and the rest of what the adult world brings. Outside of work, Laura enjoys time with family, volunteering in dog rescue, and yoga. She is fortunate to split time between Cleveland and Phoenix, making her a snowbird long before retirement age!</p>
